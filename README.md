# S7 Star Wars App

## üìÑ Description

This project involves creating a React web application that displays information about Star Wars ships by consuming data from an API. The app will show a list of ships with their essential details, and when clicked, it will display the detailed information of each ship. The project also implements pagination and protected routes for logged-in users.

The app is designed as part of a technical test for front-end developers in the e-commerce sector in Barcelona.

### Objectives

- Learn to consume data from an external API.
- Display and manage paginated data.
- Enhance user experience with dynamic navigation and detailed views.
- Implement protected routes using authentication.
- Practice Redux for state management.
- Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling and Storybook for component development.

## üìê Project Structure

### ‚≠ê **Level 1**

#### **Exercise 1**
- Implement the main screen that displays a list of Star Wars ships.
- Show key details for each ship: **Name** and **Model**.
- Fetch the list of ships from the SWAPI.

#### **Exercise 2**
- Create a detailed view for each ship.
- Display additional information like **Starship class**, **Crew**, **Length**, etc.

#### **Exercise 3**
- Implement pagination to load more ships by fetching data from the API (limit: 10 ships per page).
- Add a "View More" button to load additional ships.

#### **Exercise 4**
- Modernize the site‚Äôs design to closely resemble the official Star Wars site using Tailwind CSS.
- Add a simple navigation bar with a link to the home page.

#### **Exercise 5**
- Create a welcome screen with a button to navigate to the main ships list page.
- Use **React Router** for navigation.

#### **Exercise 6**
- Implement a login and registration page using Firebase for user management.
- Ensure that users cannot register with the same email twice.
- Redirect users to the main app once logged in.

#### **Exercise 7**
- Protect the routes so that only logged-in users can access the ships list.
